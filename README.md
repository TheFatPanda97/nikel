### Contributing

For contributing, there are a few things to look out for:

* Always use `go fmt` to format code
* Consult the article [Godoc: documenting Go code](https://blog.golang.org/godoc) on how to write docstrings if you aren't 100% sure

If you find any inconsistencies or parts of code that can be reworked, any pull requests are greatly appreciated.
